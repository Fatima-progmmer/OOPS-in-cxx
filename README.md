# 🧠 OOPS-in-CXX - Second Semester Lab Work

This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab exercises written in **C++**, completed as part of my **second semester** coursework in the Bachelor of Information Technology program.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Each program explores key OOP concepts through practical implementation:

- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ Constructors and Destructors
- ✅ Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Hierarchical)
- ✅ Polymorphism (Function Overloading, Operator Overloading, Virtual Functions)
- ✅ Encapsulation and Abstraction
- ✅ File Handling in C++
- ✅ Friend Functions and Friend Classes
- ✅ Templates (Function & Class)
- ✅ Pointers to Objects
- ✅ Exception Handling
